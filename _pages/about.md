<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Nice to meet you! I am Yihao Meng (ËíôÁ•éÊòä), currently a Ph.D. student in HKUST <a href='http://vis.cse.ust.hk/'>VisLab</a>, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by <a href='http://huamin.org/'>Prof. Huamin Qu</a>. Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence(Honor class in Qian Xuesen College) from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2023.

My research interests lie in computer vision(CV) and human computer interaction(HCI), in particular focusing on how to leverage visual analytics to support sequential decision making in crucial sectors such as healthcare and e-learning.

I enjoy engaging in communication with others, not only limited to scientific research. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
